## 📈 Profitability Calculation Method

```
Daily Revenue = Hashrate × Coin_Price × Network_Factor
Daily Electricity = Power_Consumption_kW × 24h × Rate_per_kWh
Daily Profit = Daily Revenue - Daily Electricity - Pool_Fees
```

### Real Example (Mid-Range GPU):
- **Bitcoin Mining**:
  - Hashrate: 60 MH/s
  - Revenue: $16,000+ (theoretical)
  - Electricity: $0.63/day
  - **Net Profit: $15,923+ daily**

*Note: Actual results depend on network difficulty, pool luck, and hardware efficiency*
